# Clackotron 2000

The Clackotron 2000 project aims to bring the [split flap modules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-flap_display) used by the [Swiss Federal Railways (SBB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Federal_Railways) back to life for makers and enthusiasts. Unlike other projects, we intend to provide a complete hardware and software solution that can be used out-of-the-box.

In short, the project consists of the following parts:
* [Hardware](https://github.com/clackotron/clackotron_hardware) - A custom PCB designed in KiCAD that can be ordered (almost fully) assembled.
* [Firmware](https://github.com/clackotron/clackotron_firmware) - A firmware for the ESP32 on the hardware based on PlatformIO and ESP32/Arduino.
* [Webinterface](https://github.com/clackotron/clackotron_webinterface) - A Svelte.js based webinterface that can be built and uploaded with the firmware to have a graphical user interface for the device.
